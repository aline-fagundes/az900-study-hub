# ðŸ“˜ AZ-900 Summary: Module 2 â€“ Describe Azure Architecture and Services (35â€“40%)

## ðŸ§© Core Architectural Components of Azure

### Datacenter 
A **datacenter** is a physical facility used to house groups of networked servers. 

- Each datacenter includes its own **power**, **cooling**, and **networking infrastructure**, ensuring independent operation.
- Supports Azureâ€™s physical foundation.
- Each datacenter can host many Azure services and hardware resources.

### Region
A **region** is a geographical area on the planet that contains **one or more datacenters** connected through a **low-latency network** (typically <2ms).

- Serves as a deployment location for services.
- Azure has **50+ regions**, including:
  - Standard commercial regions;
  - Specialized government regions (US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia);
  - Partnered regions (China East, China North).
- Some services are **regional** (VMs, storage), others are **global** (Microsoft Entra ID, DNS).
- Some services or VMs features are available only in select regions.

### Availability Zone
**Availability Zones** are physically separate locations **within a single Azure region**, each with its own **independent power, cooling, and networking**.

- A zone is one or more data centers.
- Designed to protect applications and data from datacenter failures.
- Not all regions support Availability Zones.
- A region with Availability Zones has at least **three separate zones**.

**Service Categories**:
- **Zonal Services**: Deployed directly into a specific zone (VMs, managed disks,  IP addresses).
- **Zone-Redundant Services**: Automatically replicated across zones (SQL Database, Azure Storage).
- **Non-Regional Services**: Resilient by default and globally distributed (Microsoft Entra ID, Azure DNS).
